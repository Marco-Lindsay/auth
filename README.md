This was a class project that I completed to learn about adding authentication to a rails app. This app uses rails version 3.2.16. It was created based on Ryan Bates railcast #250 http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch. There is a User and Session model with matching controllers and the basic extent of the functionallity is the ability to create users and create and destroy sessions.
